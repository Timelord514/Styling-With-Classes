  <h1>Paragraphs of Text</h1>
  <h2>Plus an Intro at the Top!</h2>

  <p class="intro">Here is an Intro, not an Introll. Making paragraphs with my cohort John W. Get ready, because it's about to get WILD!!!</p>
<div class="column">
  <p>Now this is the story all about how,
    My life got flipped-turned upside down,
    And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air.</p>
    </div>
  <p>  In <span class="important">West Philadelphia</span>, born and raised
    On the playground is where I spent most of my days.
    Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin all cool,
    And all shootin' some B-ball outside of the school.</p>
    
  <p> When a couple of guys who were up to no good,
    Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood.
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,
    And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air."</p>
    
  <p class="important"> I whistled for a cab, and when it came near,
    The license plate said "fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.
    If anything I could say that this cab was rare,
    But I thought "Nah forget it, Yo home to Bel Air."</p> 
    
  <p class="author"> I pulled up to the house about seven or eight,
    and I yelled to the cabby "Yo homes, smell ya later."
    Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,
    To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.</p>
